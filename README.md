- 👋 Hi, I’m @twessling, a backend developer and a strong #2 in a team.

- 👀 I’m interested in game development, the entire process. I also like concurrency/paralellism and the scalable architectures that follow from that, this is where most of my expertise lies.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Unity3D (with C#), and trying to get a game released on steam.

- 💞️ Any job offerings, I am only open for fully remote positions. Preferrably Golang for backend development, or Unity3D (C#) for game development. Given that I am (soon) moving to Asia the fully remote part is a hard requirement, I am not willing to relocate (as my spot there is gorgeous :) )

- 📫 You can reach me by sending an email to twesslin at gmail dot com, or find me on LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/ton-wessling-70600110/)

- ❓ You don't see any repositories here because I keep them all private, they are my own projects or recruiting exercises.
