- 👋 Hi, I’m @twessling, a backend developer and a strong #2 in a team. I have a master's degree in AI, but I have unfortunately not used much of that. I have, however, gathered a whole lot of experience and expertise in scalability, fault-tolerance, concurrency & paralellism. :) I prefer golang for backend software.
Also, I ❤️ gaming.

- 👀 I’m interested in game development, the entire process. I also like concurrency/paralellism and the scalable architectures that follow from that, this is where most of my expertise lies.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Unity3D (with C#), and trying to get a game playable and released on steam.

- 💞️ Any job offerings, I am only open for fully remote positions. Preferrably Golang for backend development, or Unity3D (C#) for game development. Given that I am in Asia the fully remote part is a hard requirement, I am not willing to relocate (as my spot here is gorgeous 🌞 )

- 📫 You can reach me by sending an email to twesslin@gmail.com (yes, that's without the 'g'), or find me on LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/ton-wessling-70600110/)

- ❓ You don't see any repositories here because I keep them all private, they are my own projects or recruiting exercises.
